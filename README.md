# ðŸ¤— Welcome!

## Welcome to Cryptea's Documentation

Here you'll find all the information you need to get up and running with the Cryptea. This includes our payment links/pages, down to the APIs.

## Cryptea, briefly

Cryptea is a payment processing software designed to bridge the gap between traditional businesses and the Web3 ecosystem. We leverage the power of blockchain technologies to enable seamless crypto payments.&#x20;

With Cryptea, businesses can easily set up their wallets and create payment links for transactions. The platform uses smart contracts to automate the collection of payments on the blockchain, thus adding cryptocurrency as a viable payment method for businesses.

Getting started with Cryptea is straightforward. This documentation guides users through account creation, wallet setup, and payment link generation. It also provides a Quick Start guide and an API reference for those looking to integrate Cryptea's functionalities into their existing systems. While the platform currently supports payment links, there are plans to introduce on-ramps and off-ramps soon, further enhancing its capabilities.

Cryptea aims to be a one-stop solution for businesses looking to adopt crypto payments, offering not just the tools, but also the knowledge needed to integrate cryptocurrencies into their payment systems.
