# üçµ What is Cryptea?

Cryptea is a payment processing software for Crypto payments, aimed at bridging the payment gap between businesses and Web3.

We use smart contracts to automate payment collection on the Blockchain, enabling Crypto as a payment method.&#x20;

At the moment, we support 6 chains; namely

* Polygon,
* Aurora,
* Optimism,
* Cronos,
* Oasis Emerald, and
* FilecoinEVM (to be launched soon)

and are working on accepting more chains, mostly non-EVM; such as Cardano, Tron, Solana, Harmony and Near.

### Use Cases

Businesses can integrate our APIs into their products, and websites. This enables them to receive payments directly on their own platforms.

Individuals can receive payments using their payment links. These could be used to sell resources or offer subscriptions, to customers.
