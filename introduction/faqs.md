# ‚ùî FAQs

### What do I need to use Cryptea as a business or individual?

You'd need a decentralised wallet (e.g Metamask, Trust Wallet) and your e-mail address.&#x20;

### What do I need to use Cryptea, when paying?

A decentralised wallet is the only requirement for now, and optionally, your e-mail. This is dependent on what data the business you're paying to requires.

### How can I create a payment link?

We've got a dedicated page for this, with images to guide you through the journey.

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### How can I make changes to my payment link?

If you've made a mistake while creating your payment link, and need to rectify it, you can refer to this page, where we have dedicated guides for those.

{% content-ref url="../product/creating-your-payment-link/editing-your-payment-links.md" %}
[editing-your-payment-links.md](../product/creating-your-payment-link/editing-your-payment-links.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### How do I use Cryptea in my own application/website?

To do this, you'd need to integrate with our APIs and our SDKs (coming soon). Our API reference is linked just below this text.

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
