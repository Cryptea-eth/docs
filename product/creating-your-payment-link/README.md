# 2 Creating your payment link

Here’s a short guide on creating your payment link.

* On your dashboard, navigate to the sidebar, and click on ‘Payment Links’. This would take you to a page where you can see your payment links.
* On the Payment Links page, click the ‘Create New Link’ button. This should take you to a page where you’d set up your payment link.
* On that page, choose what payment type you want to set up. This should be either ‘One Time Payments’ or ‘Subscriptions’.
* Fill in the fields required, for your payment link. For context, here’s a short description of what every field means.
  * Title: This is the name of your payment link, and what should be displayed as the title.
  * Description: This field accepts text, however short or long it is. This is the content that’d be displayed on the page. If you’re unsure what to put in here, you can leave it blank, and edit it later, from your dashboard.
  * Price: This is the amount which should be collectable through your payment link. This section is divided into three parts, which are shown as the following options:
    * Variable: This gives your users the ability to choose what amount they’d like to pay, within a set of choices. You can set up specific price choices here as well. A good use case of this is …
    * Fixed: This gives your users a specific price point, which they can pay. A good use case of this is for a product sale, where your products have a specific price.
    * Range: This gives your users free will, but only within a specific range of prices. A very good use case is a fundraiser, where individuals can choose whatever price they’d pay, only within a minimum and maximum value.
  * Link slug: This is the URL value, and what completes your link. Your payment link also routes to this value here.
* Once you’re done setting all these up, click Save. You should be able to access your payment link from https://cryptea.me/pay/{link-slug)
* You can also view your link from the dashboard, and view related analytics and data.
