# ðŸª™ Setting up your wallets

To use Cryptea, youâ€™d need an Ethereum wallet (for now, non-EVM networks aren't yet supported), and this can be set up using Metamask, or Trust Wallet.

Download any of them below, for your device.&#x20;

Please store your Seed Phrases/Private Keys securely, where only you can get to.

Once youâ€™re set-up, we can move forward to the next step.
